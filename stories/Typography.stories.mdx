# Typography

For now only basic typography styles are available. You can use them as mixins wherever they are needed.

The mixins all accept two arguments; `$font-weight` and `$font-style`. The weight defaults to bold for headers and normal for body and caption. The style is defaulted to normal for all. 

## Header big
```
@include spot-header-big($weight: bold, $style: normal)
```

## Header small
```
@include spot-header-small($weight: bold, $style: normal)
```

## Subheader big
```
@include spot-subheader-big($weight: bold, $style: normal)
```

## Subheader small
```
@include spot-subheader-small($weight: bold, $style: normal)
```

## Body big
```
@include spot-body-big($weight: normal, $style: normal)
```

## Body small
```
@include spot-body-small($weight: normal, $style: normal)
```

## Caption
```
@include spot-caption($weight: normal, $style: normal)
```
