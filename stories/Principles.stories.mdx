# Design Principles

Design principles are a set of thoughts that guide how we want to think about the user experience of our application. To quote the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/):

> USWDS Design Principles support and reflect the important guidance codified in the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act. These design principles are intended to help teams across government align on important common goals and better use the design system â€” to be an evaluative lens for design and implementation decisions. 


## Example principle one

This is an example principle. It could be that we want to emphasize a11y, or anything else.
